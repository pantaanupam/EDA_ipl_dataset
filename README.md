The main objective of this project was to learn basics of about EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis). 
In the project, I have used numpy, pandas and matplotlib library of python to anlyze the IPL(Indian Premier League) dataset.

I have used jupyter notebook for the analysis and attached the jupyter file (i.e. '.ipynb' file) along with html format of the file for the convenience.
